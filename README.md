### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Raymond Zeng, known better around the internet as **MacAndSwiss**. You probably know me from my work in the Roblox community.

I am a senior Computer Science major at the University Of California - Riverside. I hope to be able to teach others about technology in a capacity beyond YouTube videos, travel the world, and vibe while gardening plants.

You can find more information about my past works by checking out the various repositories below ðŸ‘‡
